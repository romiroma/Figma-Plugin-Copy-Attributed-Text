The plugin is used to easily copy attributed text just by selecting text node.
Default use case:
When developing applications in XCode, it's fast just to copy text from design viewer and paste attributed string into storyboard/xib's UILabel/UITextField `attributedText` field.

So, how it works:

# Start Plugin
# Select TextNode in side navigator or on canvas

That's it, now you have attributed text from TextNode copied into your clipboard! Paste it into editors, what support that and enjoy!
